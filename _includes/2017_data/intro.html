                  Charged, Secure Braodcast & NSBelfast are hosting an 8 week training course that will teach the fundamentals to iOS app development, starting the week of May 14th. The aim of the course is to go from “0 to app” in 4 months.  The course will be aimed at students, postgrads and anyone who wishes to get into iOS development.
                  This is not aimed at people with no code experience as this course is designed to teach iOS development and not how to code.
                </p>

                  The bootcamp will consist of eight 2 hour sessions that will occur once a week. Following the initial teaching, the sponsors will offer potential app ideas and themes. The bootcamp participants will then decide upon an app idea and go off and create their idea. The participants will have 12 weeks to create their app and pitch it to the sponsors at the end of that 12 week period. During the first 4 weeks of the 12 week app development period there will be drop in sessions so participants will be able to call in to get help with their app.
                </p>
